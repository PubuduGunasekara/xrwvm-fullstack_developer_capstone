## Project Overview
This capstone project challenges you to create a dynamic and functional full stack application that showcases your proficiency in modern web development technologies. The application will include features such as user authentication, database operations, RESTful services, and cloud deployment. The goal is to develop a showpiece that demonstrates your capability to potential employers.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend:** Node.js, Django
- **Database:** NoSQL (MongoDB)
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- **Serverless Deployment:** IBM Code Engine
- **Cloud Deployment:** Kubernetes
- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript

## Features
- **Responsive Frontend:** Create static and dynamic pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
- **User Management:** Implement user registration, authentication, and administration.
- **Backend Services:** Develop RESTful APIs and backend services using Django and Node.js.
- **Database Integration:** Perform CRUD operations with MongoDB.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Configure continuous integration and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins.
- **Containerization:** Containerize the application using Docker.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy the containerized application on IBM Code Engine and manage it with Kubernetes.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Breadcrumbsxrwvm-fullstack_developer_capstone.git
   cd fullstack-capstone
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```
   - Configure environment variables (e.g., database connection string).

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```

4. **Database Setup:**
   - Ensure MongoDB is installed and running.
   - Configure MongoDB connection settings in the backend.

5. **Containerization:**
   - Build Docker images for both frontend and backend:
     ```sh
     docker build -t frontend ./frontend
     docker build -t backend ./backend
     ```

6. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Set up GitHub Actions or Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.

7. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application to IBM Code Engine and Kubernetes.

## Usage
To run the application locally:

1. **Start the Backend Server:**
   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Server:**
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the Application:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
